                Famed for the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple, and the Memorial Temple of Hatshepsut, the Nile-side
                town of Luxor in Upper Egypt has a glut of tourist attractions. This is ancient Thebes, power base of
                the New Kingdom pharaohs, and home to more sights than most can see on one visit.
                Luxor's east bank is home the modern city, with its vibrant souq; the two temples of Karnak and Luxor;
                and the museum. The west bank's lush farmland and barren cliffs are where the vast majority of Luxor's
                tourist attractions sit, with so many tomb and temple sights that it has been called the biggest
                open-air museum in the world.
                Spend a few days here exploring the colorful wall art of the tombs and gazing in awe at the colossal
                columns in the temples, and you'll see why Luxor continues to fascinate historians and archaeologists.

                The last surviving wonder of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pyramids of Giza are one of the
                world's most recognizable landmarks. Having awed travelers down through the ages, these tombs of the
                Pharaohs Cheops (Khufu), Chephren (Khafre), and Mycerinus (Menkaure), guarded by the enigmatic Sphinx,
                are usually top of most visitor's lists of tourist attractions to see in Egypt and often the first sight
                they head to after landing.Today, sitting on the desert edge of Cairo's sprawl, these megalithic
                memorials to dead pharaohs are still as wondrous a sight as they ever were and an undeniable highlight
                of any Egypt trip.

                Egypt's most tranquil town is Aswan, set upon the winding curves of the Nile. Backed by orange-hued
                dunes, this is the perfect place to stop and unwind for a few days and soak up the chilled-out
                atmosphere. Take the river ferry across to Elephantine Island and stroll the colorful streets of the
                Nubian villages. Then ride a camel to the desert monastery of St. Simeon on Aswan's east bank.
                Afterwards, relax in one of the riverboat restaurants while watching the lateen-sailed feluccas drift
                past.

                Below the Red Sea's surface is another world as fascinating as the temples and tombs on land.
                The coral reefs of the Red Sea are renowned among scuba divers for both the soft corals on display and
                the vast amount of sea life, ranging from colorful reef fish and nudibranchs, to sharks, dolphins,
                turtles, rays, and even dugongs.
                For divers, the most famous town to base yourself in is Sharm el-Sheikh on the Sinai Peninsula, closest
                to the reefs of Ras Mohammed National Park, as well as the reefs of the Straits of Tiran.
                To dive the sites of the Straits of Gubal head to Hurghada or El Gouna on the Red Sea coast, while
                advanced divers should check out the resort of Marsa Alam, the nearest base for diving Egypt's "deep
                south" dive sites.

                Sitting in isolation, in the western corner of the Western Desert, Siwa is the tranquil tonic to the
                hustle of Egypt's cities. This gorgeous little oasis, surrounded by date palm plantations and numerous
                hot-water springs, is one of the Western Desert's most picturesque spots.
                Siwa town is centered around the ruins of a vast mud-brick citadel, known as the Fortress of Shali,
                which dominates the view, while various temple remnants, including the Temple of the Oracle where
                Alexander the Great is said to have come to receive advice, are scattered throughout the wider oasis
                area. This is a top spot to wind down and go slow for a few days, as well as being an excellent base
                from which to plan adventures into the surrounding desert.

                One of the oldest monasteries in the world, St. Catherine's stands at the foot of Mount Sinai, amid the
                desert mountains of the Sinai Peninsula, where Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandments.
                This desert monastery is home to an incredible collection of religious iconography, art, and manuscripts
                (some of which can be seen in the on-site museum), as well as the burning bush.
                For most visitors here, a trip to St. Catherine's also involves a hike up Mount Sinai to see sunrise or
                sunset. Take the camel path for the easy route, or climb the famous Steps of Repentance if you want
                better views.
